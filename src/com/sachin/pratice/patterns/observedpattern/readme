purpose:  Lets one or more objects be notified of state changes in other objects within the system.

Uses:
  State changes in one or more objects should trigger behavior in other objects
  Broadcasting capabilities are required.
  An understanding exists that objects will be blind to the expense of notification.
  
Example
This pattern can be found in almost every GUI environment. When buttons, text, and other fields are placed in applications the application typically registers as a listener for those controls. When a user triggers an event, such as clicking a button, the control iterates through its registered observers and sends a notification to each.
