Purpose: Supplies a single interface to a set of interfaces within a system
Uses
 a. A simple interface is needed to provide access to a complex system.
 b. There are many dependencies between system implementations[NCShandler, Grv3 Handler] and clients[RESTWebServices].
 c. Systems and subsystems should be layered
 
 By exposing a set of functionalities through a web service the client code needs to only worry
 about the simple interface being exposed to them and not the complex relationships that
 may or may not exist behind the web service layer. A single web service call to update
 a system with new data may actually involve communication with a number of databases and
 systems, however this detail is hidden due to the implementation of the façade pattern
